# About the project

[![Spectroscopy GUI Overview](./docs/assets/images/screenshots/spectroscopy_gui_thumbnail_general.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ys8IoJaCI0)

Welcome to [FLIM LABS Spectroscopy](https://github.com/flim-labs/spectroscopy-py), a Python application designed to **analyze the fluorescence intensity decay as a function of time** and plotting a decay profile histogram. Facilitated by an underlying data processor developed in Rust, responsible for data retrieval from the hardware component, this application enables real-time data analysis and visualization. Whether your focus is on rigorous data analysis or dynamic visualizations, Spectroscopy serves as a flexible tool for the precise measurement and exploration of fluorescence intensity decay profile.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To directly test the application, skipping the prerequisites and installation requirements you can download an installer at this [link](https://github.com/flim-labs/spectroscopy-py/releases/tag/v1.0) (_Note: you still need to have the FLIM LABS acquisition card_).

To get a local copy up and running follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

To be able to run this project locally on your machine you need to satisfy these requirements:

- Windows OS (>= Windows 10)
- 4GB RAM
- Multicore CPU
- Possess a [FLIM LABS acquisition card](https://www.flimlabs.com/products/data-acquisition-card/) to be able to acquire your data
- ZestSC3 drivers installed
- Python version <= 3.9

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/flim-labs/spectroscopy-py
   ```
2. Set the virtual environment in the root folder
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```sh
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install the dependencies
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run the project with GUI mode
   ```sh
   python spectroscopy.py
   ```
